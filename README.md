#Interview Trainer Agent (RAG-Based AI)

Overview

The Interview Trainer Agent is an AI-powered assistant developed using IBM Watsonx.ai Studio and Granite Foundation Models. It is designed to help users prepare for job interviews by providing customized interview questions, answer tips, and preparation guidance based on the user’s job role and experience level. The agent uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull relevant information from uploaded interview FAQ documents and generate real-time, natural language responses without any coding.
